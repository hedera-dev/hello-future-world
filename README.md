# Ħello World, Ħello Future

❓ So you want to develop on [Hedera](https://hedera.com/).

🤷 Not sure where to start?

🕙 Why not start with something you could complete in 10 minutes?

🏁 Let's go! 🎉🎉🎉

## Hello World Sequences

There are multiple Hello World sequences for you to follow along.

To start, you **must** do the first sequence,
as you will need a **funded account** to do any other tasks on Hedera.
Subsequently, you can do the remaining sequences in any order.

- [Create and fund an account](./00-create-fund-account/)
- [HFS: Files with SDK](./01-hfs-files-sdk/)
- [HSCS: Smart contract with SDK](./02-hscs-smart-contract-sdk/)
- [HSCS: Smart contract with EthersJs](./03-hscs-smart-contract-ethersjs/)
- [HTS: Fungible token with SDK](./04-hts-ft-sdk/)
- [HTS: Non-fungible token with SDK](./05-hts-nft-sdk/)
